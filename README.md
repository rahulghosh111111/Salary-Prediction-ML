# Salary Prediction 💼

A web application that predicts an individual's salary based on input features like education, experience, and job role. This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be deployed with Flask for real-time predictions.

## 🔍 Overview

The application takes user inputs such as years of experience, education level, job title, and other relevant attributes, then predicts an estimated salary using a trained regression model. It provides an easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the model.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts salary based on user input
- Clean and responsive Flask-based web interface
- Real-time prediction using a machine learning regression model
- Lightweight and easy to deploy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** – Web framework
- **Scikit-learn** – For training and using the regression model
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **HTML/CSS** – For the frontend layout and styling
